    <p>Bio  <br>Prof. Kerem <br>Rızvanoğlu  is a faculty member and the current Dean of the Faculty <br>of Communication at Galatasaray University. </p>  <p> Since 1999, <br>he's been teaching and publishing in the area of human-computer <br>interaction (HCI), specifically on user experience research and <br>design.  He received numerous national and international awards for <br>his publications. </p>  <p> Since 2001, <br>Rızvanoğlu has been teaching UX research and design at <br>undergraduate, graduate, and certification levels in various <br>universities, including past roles at Boğaziçi University and Koç <br>University, which are also pivotal universities in Turkey. </p>  <p> He is the <br>founding president and current board member of the Turkish chapter of <br>the User Experience Professionals Association (UXPA). </p>  <p> Additionally, <br>he co-founded Xedzone Research and Consulting, the first private <br>research company in Turkey, which was dedicated to UX centered <br>research, consultancy, and training. Over two decades, he's been <br>providing UX research, design, education, and strategy consulting to <br>prominent sectors like e-commerce, digital banking, and <br>telecommunications. <br>  <br>In recent <br>years, Rızvanoğlu's research interests focused on "Diversity, <br>Inclusion, and Accessibility." Through different initiatives he <br>contributes to the efforts in understanding and improving how diverse <br>user groups-such as individuals from different cultures, elderly <br>users, children, and people with disabilities-interact with <br>platforms like websites, mobile apps, VR environments, wearable <br>technologies, and generative AI platforms. His work focuses on <br>enhancing UX through these platforms while generating new ideas to <br>improve the quality of life for such communities through <br>human-centered design.</p>  <p> Believing <br>in the deontological importance of diversity and inclusion, <br>Rızvanoğlu also highlights the competitive commercial advantages of <br>offering inclusive experiences to these communities. <br>  <br>He is a <br>columnist in Mediacat (https://mediacat.com/yazar/kerem-rizvanoglu/) <br>and has a podcast named "Deneyim Stüdyosu (Experience Studio)", <br>which is streaming on Apple Podcast and Spotify <br>(https://shorturl.at/YMSwd)"</p>  <p> Abstract  <br>Title: <br> " HCI  <br> for <br>Social Impact: Designing for Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility "  <br> </p>  <p> In <br>this seminar, Prof. Rızvanoğlu will present an overview his recent <br>studies, which outline a comprehensive research agenda in <br>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) focusing on Interdisciplinary HCI <br>for Social Impact, specifically leveraging the critical and <br>trans-disciplinary frameworks of the later HCI paradigms. The central <br>theme is "Improving Quality of Life through Diversity, Inclusion, <br>and Accessibility (DIA)", addressing how diverse user groups, <br>including older adults, children, and people with disabilities, <br>interact with technology.  The studies demonstrate how DIA principles <br>can be systematically applied across emerging technologies-from <br>voice assistants and gen AI systems for older adults to virtual <br>reality environments and urban mobility solutions. Key <br>research streams involve the design of Human-Centered AI (HCAI)  <br> including <br>the iMuse model for cultural heritage accessibility and empathic <br>voice assistant design for elder users. Through other complementary <br>studies on "digital identity and experience" such as gender <br>stereotypes in educational games, queer player experience in virtual <br>worlds, and feminist identity on dating platforms, the seminar <br>illustrates how interdisciplinary HCI research can bridge theory and <br>practice to improve quality of life for vulnerable populations.</p>
