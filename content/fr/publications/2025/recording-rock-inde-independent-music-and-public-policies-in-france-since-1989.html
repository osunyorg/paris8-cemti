  This panel, organized in collaboration with MCI (Mémoire du CIR et de l’IRMA), will focus on the public policies elaborated in France to support the production and distribution of indie rock recordings. In 1989, a “Plan Rock” imagined by Bruno Lion was financed by the French ministry of culture to develop several public actions, in particular towards independent music labels (MCI archives; Castagnac, 1993; Teillet, 2002). Twenty years later, they formed a national federation with independent distributors to defend a particular way to record music and a different approach of the economy of music (Pétrotto, 2012; FELIN, 2013). This panel will question more broadly the issues related to cultural diversity, discoverability and cultural policies (Rioux, 2022) in the actual digital economy characterized by the plaformisation of music (Kaiser, 2023).
