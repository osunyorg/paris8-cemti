abstract: >-
  When dealing with the relationship between media, culture and society, interdisciplinarity has always been a major issue for researchers. As a matter of fact, a wide outlook crossing the analyses from different social sciences disciplines is a necessity to understand the social, political, anthropological and economic consequences of communication tools on our everyday life. This need for interdisciplinarity appeared very soon during the XXth century with the development of media and international cultural exchanges. This was the case with media studies and the emergence of academic interdisciplines like “Sciences of information and communication” mixing the contributions of political economy of communication, linguistics, sociology, anthropology, semiotics. Two examples illustrates what interdisciplinarity can mean when an investigation project appeals to researches belonging to different academic fields : 1- minority languages groups struggling to protect their cultures and 2- the making of television news as studied by the Glasgow Media Group.
