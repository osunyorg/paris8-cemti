abstract: >-
  Analysing Popular music raises some interesting questions and problems about the nature of this term and about how one makes sense of the object of study, especially in the field of Communication. Understanding the sounds, words and images of popular music leads directly towards debates about dynamics of power and influence. In a time of cultural diversity and globalization, the construction of cultural identities or resistance to dominant forms of culture may also be discussed in a culturalist perspective.
