  This deliverable is part of WP3 whose main objective is to "critically investigate the socio economic frameworks and the forms of value creation and impact measurement in the fast changing knowledge based-economy, that are shaping the evolution of future internet architectures, the forms of social interaction, and of democracy". (DoW WP3) This task will advance the state of the art through a critical review of different approaches on the information revolution and of the cognitive economy based on the ground-breaking work on cognitive capitalism and collective intelligence (DoW WP3)
