  His research focuses on the media and culture, and more specifically on local contexts in France and abroad, and public policy on popular music. During a three-year period as associate researcher in the Audiovisual Department of the French National Library, he researched an unexplored archival collection on the French recording industry. Translation: Saskia Brown. Abstract: with the rise of a new medium linked to the emergence of new musical cultures, methods of music production changed and new practices were developed in the course of the second half of the twentieth century. The institutions involved in heritage collection had to review how they operated, particularly in the light of the legal deposit of sound recordings. Additionally, when popular song recordings increased exponentially, a whole set of broader questions emerged around the status of sound recordings, within these institutions and also in the public and political spheres. It was only when the Head of the National Sound Archives joined forces with the Recording Industry's Trade Union in order to redefine the value of the vinyl record that these recordings became accepted as artistic and cultural works.
