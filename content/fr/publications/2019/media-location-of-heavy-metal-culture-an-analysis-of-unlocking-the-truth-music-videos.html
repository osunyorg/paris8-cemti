  The paper aims to locate the heavy metal culture from media representations of the band Unlocking The Truth. This group of metalheads, composed of black teenagers from Brooklyn, is known to have given up a $ 1.8 million contract with Sony Music to finally release their first album Chaos on TuneCore in 2016. That’s when their first clip “Take Control” was broadcasted. It was followed by a second one in 2017 “My chains”. By analyzing these two music-videos as « musical-visual expression » (Gaudin, 2018), it is possible to situate the sensory and significant experiences they offer. “Take Control” will be perceived as “performancial” and “narrative” (Gaudin, 2018) to express an attachment to a community of “proud pariah(s)” (Weinstein, 2000). “My Chains”, which has the same aesthetic, questions more broadly gender and race issues within a community which is not only of class (Weinstein, 2011 ; Brown, 2016) but also of tastes (Guibert &amp; Guibert, 2016). This work is thus interested in seeing new possible relations between sounds and images within the heavy metal culture.
