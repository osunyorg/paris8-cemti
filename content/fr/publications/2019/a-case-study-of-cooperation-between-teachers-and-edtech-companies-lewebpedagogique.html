  This article aims at exploring the strategies developed by LeWebPédagogique, an actor in the educational technology sector, when describing itself as a "community of teachers". Using data collected during participant observation and semi-structured interviews with contributors of the firm, we show that this expression lies at the heart of LeWebPédagogique's marketing strategy and economical model. It also epitomizes its capacity to address teachers and to mobilize them to produce school-proof content displayed on various platforms, playing on the appeal that "author" status exerts on teachers. On the other hand, we try to reveal the motivations of teachers who chose to collaborate with LeWebPédagogique while developing "proto-communities" (Baron &amp; Zablot, 2017). Could teachers build specific "strategies" (de Certeau, 1980) in order to stage themselves as innovative or "teaching stars"? Based on the analysis of semi-structured interviews with teachers occupying the roles of beta-testers, content producers or target audience, we also tried to understand if these collaborations could throw light upon a feeling of deprofessionalization in an institutional context that would lead teachers to work with the private actor.
